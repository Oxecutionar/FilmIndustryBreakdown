This is a dataset from kaggle that shows over 200 films per year from 1986 to 2016. With this data I wanted to see how much of an influence budget had versus revenue 
and also look to see what other factors had correlations that had an effect on the films. 
With the data set I had to clean most of the data columns I wanted to use, such as parsing dates from strings and converting, as well as changing value types and 
using the matplotlib library to create correlation charts.
